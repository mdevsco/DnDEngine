    /// in D&D. Many gamers gather a set of D6 for quickly rolling multiples,
    /// like the original 3D6 rolls for attributes during character creation. This

    /// assigning each number where the player wants.

    /// numbered 0 to 9, and the faces of the other go from 00 to 90 by tens.

    /// with one exception: a double zero roll is 100.

    /// between combat turns.

    /// the D20 rolls further because it is the most spherical. The faces are
    /// equilateral triangles.â€‹ The D20 is used any time you want to know if an
    /// attempt is successful: attacks, saving throws, skill checks, and ability
    /// checks. Each value has a 5% chance.
    /// After you roll a D20 to see if you hit an enemy, you will roll other dice
    /// to see how much damage you deal. Small weapons use a D4, larger
    /// weapons deal D6 or D8 damage, and the biggest deal D10 or D12.
    /// D20, The "decider" of D&D dice.
